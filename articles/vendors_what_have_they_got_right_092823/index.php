                        Vendors continue to play a vital role as functional and technical experts in the domains they operate in. Whether it be
                        market structure and conventions, regulatory overhauls or providing connectivity to financial market infrastructures
                        and market participants, a technology vendor is a go-to resource for how to operate most efficiently in a particular
                        market or asset class
                      </p>
                      <h2>
                        Highly Dependable
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Most vendor systems are highly resilient. In fact, the lack of upgrades discussed in our previous post helps them in
                        this regard, because the more changes made, the more likely you are to experience downtime. Most clients value
                        stability above all, so unreliable products simply donâ€™t survive.

                        Very Fast Time-to-market.
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        It has always been (and will continue to be) the case that a business can get off to a very fast start by purchasing a
                        fully functioning off-the-shelf product from a tech vendor. This makes it an ideal choice for early-stage businesses.
                        Any internal build project will take much longer, require skillsets the client may not have or want, and be subject to
                        the execution risk that comes with tech builds.
                      </p>

                        Known Fixed Cost
                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        Although the subscription model is still nascent, even with a multi-year contract the total cost is known upfront and
                        can be budgeted for. If the client decides to acquire, be acquired, or exit the business the technology cost associated
                        with each option is known.
                      </p>

                        Having reviewed the good and the bad of enterprise vendor technology to date, in our next posts we will turn our focus
                        to what the future may hold.
