                        It’s hard to believe that it’s been over 50 years since Instinet and NASDAQ first launched electronic order quoting and
                        routing, and over 40 since Bloomberg first launched the Terminal. By addressing industrywide challenges in trading and
                        market data, these pioneering firms helped to sow the seeds for the rise of the capital markets solutions vendor. Over
                        the years, these enterprise-focused vendors have expanded their offerings and adapted to a constantly shifting
                        landscape, all while facing regulatory and competitive headwinds.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Much of the recent competition they have faced has come from fintech startups, whose agility enables them to “build
                        fast and break stuff” while solving specific challenges often overlooked by larger vendors. But newcomers can’t build
                        or deploy in a vacuum, and given the usually narrow focus of their offerings, they need to build to integrate with
                        legacy enterprise technology. Collaboration is almost always necessary.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, will legacy solutions providers disappear completely? No. Will the future asset manager, bank, or broker-dealer run
                        completely on applications from startups? No. The reality is that the technology vendor of the future will combine
                        enterprise-grade capabilities with startup agility. But what exactly does that look like?

                        In this series of articles, we’re going to look at what’s worked, what’s been missing and what vendors need to do in
                        order to drive material modernization in the industry over the next few years. We’ll start with the most topical,
                        logical question – where are we now? How close are we to full health in capital markets technology solutions, and are
                        vendors doing their part to keep costs down and innovation rapid?
