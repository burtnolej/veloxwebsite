                      Turbo-charging Innovation</h1>
                      <h2>How does the immovable object overcome the unstoppable force?  </h2>
                      
                      <p>
                      I was asked recently about the biggest challenge I faced during my 20+ years managing 
                      sales & trading technology in Capital Markets. My answer was managing the difference between 
                      the front office business demand for technological innovation, such as new systems and 
                      upgrades and the ability of the front office technology department to supply it, quickly and affordably.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      There are many factors that drove this; good, bad, technical and non-technical but 
                      certainly the ability of a software system (or systems) to adapt was always a factor.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Below I have listed what I think are the top 6 factors that slowed our ability to innovate: </p>
                      <p>
                      <h3>Getting the right data into the right state to be useful and actionable.</h2> </p>
                      <p>
                      Data and the need for it to be treated as an asset to be managed, curated, and prized was 
                      not always recognized. As most "new" features were dependent on data from multiple sources, 
                      a lot of additional work was required to get the right data into the right state to be 
                      useful and actionable.</p>
                      <p>
                      <h3>Managing thick client applications.</h2></p>
                      <p>
                      Even to this day, most production systems employ a traditional client server architecture 
                      with a thick client (UI) locally installed on the desktop, often managed by a separate team. 
                      Keeping the UI performant, dealing with complexity of spreading business logic across 
                      client and server and different teams invariably created friction.</p>
                                                                        
                      <p><h3>Corralling a mixture of in-house and 3rd party technologies</h3></p>

                      <p>Typically, architectures were functionally decomposed and implemented with a mixturefferent technologies, 
                      some in-house, some 3rd party. Each catered to a broad range of uses that were generallyeeded for the problem 
                      at hand and getting them to "play nice" together was alwaysllenge.</p>
                                                    
                      <p><h3>Difficulty adapting systems that were built to solve discretness problems.</h3></p> 
                      
                      <p>Systems were sponsored and built to solve a discrete business problem. They were not general. 
                      Because the future was notoriously hard to predict this usually meant additional effort 
                      to bend systems to accommodate a new feature, creating "technical debt" in the process.</p>                 
                      
                      <p><h3>A lack of good development tools. </h3> </p>
                      
                      <p>A lack of development tools also meant app dev had a tendency to operate at too low a 
                      level, too much time was needed to be spent reinventing solutions to 
                      thorny non-functional issues like performance and resilience instead of writing business code.</p>
                      
                      <p><h3>An inability to test efficiently. </h3></p>
                      
                      <p>Finally, sales & trading was and is a business-critical function with punitive financial, 
                      reputational, and legal penalties in the event of major failures. 
                      Systems just needed to work. Fully thinking about testing before building 
                      was also a concept that was recognized later.</p>
