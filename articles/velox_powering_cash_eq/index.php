                      <p>
                        Platforms power progress by “centralizing expertise but decentralizing innovation to the end client or user” (thank you
                        thoughtworks).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But the platforms that succeed have evolved to provide solutions for entire teams not just the core tasks that they
                        were originally built for.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        For instance, game engines (like Unreal), evolved from providing 2d/3d rendering, to centralizing expertise in terrain
                        generation, physics collision, animation, character design, network play, platform portability and much more.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Application hosting platforms (like AWS, Azure etc) have evolved from providing compute & networking as a service to
                        centralizing expertise in data management, automation & orchestration, security & compliance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Content management platforms (like WIX, Wordpress) have added multi language support, version control, built-in SEO,
                        traffic analyzers & optimizers, integrations (with payment providers) and even the ability to migrate between other
                        CMS’.

                        velox is following in these footsteps in Equity Trading

                      <p>
                        In addition to accelerating the build of full stack trading systems like E/OMS, market making and algo trading, the
                        Velox application development platform (vCore) centralizes expertise needed to rapidly consolidate legacy apps to a
                        single platform, build cross-system exception-based workflows, modernize trading UI’s to be deployable in a web browser
                        and many of the other tasks that front-office teams face.
